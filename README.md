Game Store Database
-------------------

This repository contains design and implementation documents for a MySQL database for a video game store, as well as the schema file to set it up. 

The database makes use of MySQL features such as schemas, primary and foreign keys (including composite and self-referencing keys), constraints for data integrity, and example queries that demonstrate joins and aggregations.
